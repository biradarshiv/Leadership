The leader does things to get the leadership qualities out of other people.
Get the positiveness out of people, just for the betterment of them and the world.
Have a bigger picture of positivity for them and the world.
Carry the positive energy with you, people should feel the energy radiated by you in the body language, words, smile, tone.
You already have it, just let it flow.

Find out how that motivation can help others in motivating themselves.

Time Management
Time is all that we have.

-----------------------------------------------
Solve better problems
Greatness of a person is measured by the solution a person provides, to a problem that is faced by many a people in world.
Just 400 years ago we had kings, now we don't have any of them and also their property deteriorates with time.
